## 📜 The Narrative
You have stumbled upon a legacy terminal used by **"The Obsidian Group"**, a shadow organization dismantled in the late 90s. Rumor has it their core database contains proof of extraterrestrial contact. The system is partially corrupted and locked down.

**Your Mission:** Bypass the security layers, recover the fragmented credentials, and access the "Core Truth".

## 🎮 How to Play
This is a **Capture The Flag (CTF)** style website. Each level requires you to use real-world web debugging and hacking techniques to find the "Flag".

1.  **Level 0: Entry** - Inspect the HTML source.
2.  **Level 1: Clearance** - Check the Browser Console.
3.  **Level 2: Authentication** - Investigate Cookies and Local Storage.
4.  **Level 3: Interception** - Analyze Network Headers.
5.  **Level 4: Decryption** - Crack the Code (Cryptography).
6.  **Level 5: The Ghost** - Find hidden files (`robots.txt`).
7.  **Level 6: Spectrum** - Analyze assets (Steganography).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-   **Frontend:** React (Vite)
